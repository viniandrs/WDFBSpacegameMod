# Space game mod

This is a browser game which I developed from a project for the Microsoft's curriculum "[Web Development for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners))". The base game can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/tree/main/6-space-game/solution).

The purpose behind this mod is to practice some OOP programming in Javascript as well as to test some ideas I have for game development. Currently everything was created with pure Javascript, but I intend to test some frameworks later on.
